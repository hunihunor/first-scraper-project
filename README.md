My first made, AI supported web scraping project that helps me automate a task at my workspace.

After running the serves.js from command line, loading the http://localhost:3000/ from a browser, choosing a date and submitting it logs in to the administrative platform of a dental clinic, goes through the chosen date and creates a table of the patients that have appointment that day and have fix discount saved in their file.
Pretty simple but struggled a lot to get this far.

I am still planning to make it into a shareable, user-friendly to run thing so all my non-tech savvy colleagues could also use it.
